Welcome to my note taker app!

## Description

This is a simple note taking application using an Express server that will save your data to a db.json in the app directory. 

## Useage

Visit `https://fierce-wildwood-75541.herokuapp.com/` and express will direct you to the home page. Click on the "Get Started" button to be directed to the note taking page. Here you can edit notes in the right panel. When both a title and a body are supplied, a save button will appear in the top right. Saving a note will display it in the left panel, and allow it to be viewed when selected. Hitting the red delete icon will delete the note.
